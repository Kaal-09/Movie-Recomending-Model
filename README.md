# Movie-Recomending-Model

This project is a machine learning model designed to recommend movies based on user history and preferences. By analyzing past viewing habits and similarities between users, it predicts movies best suited to a user’s taste, either by genre or as general recommendations.

## Features
- Personalized Recommendations: Recommends movies based on user history.
  
- Collaborative Filtering: Uses similarities among users to improve suggestions.
  
- Genre-Based or General Recommendations: Allows recommendations with or without genre-specific filters.

## Methodology
The recommendation system is built using a blend of two primary approaches:

- Content-Based Filtering: This technique recommends movies similar to those that the user has liked in the past. It considers movie attributes, such as genre, director, and actors, and suggests movies with similar characteristics. This method is effective for new users, as it relies solely on their viewing history.

- Collaborative Filtering: By using user-item interaction data, this approach identifies users with similar preferences and recommends movies based on what similar users have enjoyed. Collaborative filtering is implemented here in two ways:
          1. User-Based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies based on the preferences of users with similar viewing habits.
          2. Item-Based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies that are similar to those already watched by the user, based on ratings or engagement.

- Hybrid Recommendation Model: The hybrid model combines content-based and collaborative filtering to produce better, more diverse recommendations by addressing the limitations of each method. This approach ensures that recommendations are both user-specific and content-relevant.
